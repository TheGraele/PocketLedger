# Pocket Ledger

A lightweight World of Warcraft addon that tracks gold across all your characters, monitors session earnings, and keeps tabs on your active auctions.

## Features

- **Account-Wide Gold Tracking** — See gold totals for every character on your account in one place, color-coded by class.
- **Session Summary** — Tracks how much gold you've earned or spent since logging in.
- **Auction House Tracking** — Automatically scans your active auctions when you visit the AH, showing item details, buyout prices, and color-coded time remaining.
- **Mini Gold Tracker** — A small, draggable on-screen display showing your current gold. Click it to open the full Pocket Ledger window.
- **Slash Commands** — `/ibot` or `/infobot` to toggle the window, `/ibot reset` to reset your session baseline, `/ibot help` for usage info.
